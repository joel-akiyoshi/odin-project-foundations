    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Japanese curry is a simple and hearty meal that tastes great. It's one of my favorite comfort foods —
       warm, rich, and perfect over a bed of freshly steamed rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 lb carrots, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>2 lb boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 pack (4 bricks) of Golden Curry roux</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and sauté until lightly browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and carrots, then pour in 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Break the Golden Curry bricks into smaller pieces and add them to the pot. Stir until the roux is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the curry thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over bowls of steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For extra flavor, try adding a splash of soy sauce or a grated apple while simmering.</li>
        <li>You can substitute beef or pork for chicken if preferred.</li>
        <li>Leftovers taste even better the next day after the flavors meld.</li>
    </ul>
